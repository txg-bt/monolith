 
To install dependencies & run the projects
    - need node installed on your computer and postgres
    - I personally use yarn to handle package management, the project will also work as expected with npm, but please remove the yarn.lock files if you intend to use npm
    - Inside each project - yarn install/ npm install

To run the apps
yarn start/ npm run start

Please make sure you first start the BE

the apps will run on 3 ports
BE - 5000
Client - 5001
Vendor - 5002

In order to configure BE
inside the src/database/db.sql there is the structure for the postgres DB - please add it by hand in postgres
- there is code to add 10 restaurants - please modify the commands with the user_ids generated after you register 2 users - if you want data, otherwise feel free to create the restaurants from vendor UI

to connect with your db

at root level, there is a .env file which contains the credentials to DB - if you don't see the file - please enable hidden files
The default config for PG is set there, you will need to update
PG_USER=
PG_PASSWORD=

with your values

The BE has logs for ease of debug, feel free to brag about that :)

There might be typos in the projects - if you find them and consider them annoying, feel free to edit them - in theory eveything works as expected
There are pieces of code that are not in the best condition - there are un-used deps/ react props that are not configured with propTypes

IF you itnent to add the projects to github, add a .gitignore with Node preset
